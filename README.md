# Reddit Comment Copy
This is a simple extension that gives you a context menu in a Reddit comment thread
that lets you copy the current comment with or without its parent context.

* Without context will copy the current comment's permalink to your clipboard
* With context will copy the current comment's permalink plus "?context=10000"
    to your clipboard, showing the parent comments while still highlighting the
    permalinked comment.

2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
3. Enable "Developer Mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load Unpacked Extension..." in the top left
5. Select the cloned folder and hit "Select"
